DONE:
*Get update function running.
*Have RMS Backup only read and write from 'seqdb1.rms'. This applies both to the RMS and backup files from old versions.
*Fix VibeTools refusing to import songs when the RMS is empty.
*Bring RMS Backup and VibeTools under the same roof and integrate them into the 'Open' menu(perhaps call it 'Songs' instead).
*Add rudimentary drag'n'jab support to make this app usable on touchphones.
*Fix screen orientation bugs.

Yus:
*Find away to have both setFullScreenMode(true) and working softkey menus.
*Fix aspect ratio of things after doing the above.
*Add file operations in VibeTools.
*Add preview function to VibeTools so you don't have to import the song to hear it.
*Clean up the fucking mess in VibeTools class.
*Clean up menus in VibeTools.
*Add confirmation dialogs in VibeTools.
*Have Vibe check if anymore space is available in RMS before writing. See getRecordSize(int recordID) and getSizeAvailable().
*Prevent changed song order from causing havoc when saving again.

Likely:
*Show current version and updated version in update screen.
*Riff shift(horizontal transposition).

Less likely:
*Show feature news when update when update is found.
*Add compression functions for general use(gzip suggested).
*Song compression inside RMS.
*Some theming would be nice.
*Add full touchscreen support.
*Bluetooth/IR song sending and receiving.
*Pack transposition functions into one submenu.

Far out:
*Reverse engineer the server from the Vibe client.
*Fix the Online menus in the modded version after doing the previous.
*Fuck reverse engineering the damned netcode, build my own from scratch.
