Vibe Mod version 1.2.13

Vibe is probably one of the few tools for composing polyphonic music on J2ME enabled phones. Sporting an intuitive piano-roll interface, Vibe is the perfect tool for writing music whenever/wherever inspiration hits you.
This is a modded version and has extra features:
*Backing up of RMS.
*Exporting and importing of songs in native .vbm format.
*Midi export.
*In-app update checks.
*Increased maximum tempo to 500 and title length to 99.
*Transposing by note and octave.
*Basic touchscreen support.

Using the touchscreen:
The touch controls are rough at the moment and cursor is moved around by dragging.
In the track arranger, short tap selects while long press edits pattern.
In the pattern editor, short tap places note while long press changes its length.
Volume is also changeable via the indicator on the lower left. 
A short tap changes note/track volume while a long press changes row volume in drumtrack editor.

Important:
Vibe tends to corrupt data if too many songs are saved, so do backups once in a while.
It breaks at around 50 songs/120 KB on a SE K750/W800 and this will vary from phone to phone.
